### Problem Statement:

You are required to build a small React application that simulates a simple online marketplace. In this marketplace, users can view a list of available products and add them to their shopping cart.

Specifications:

1. **Product List:**
   - Each product should have a name, price, and a "Add to Cart" button.
   - The product list should be fetched from a public API: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`.

2. **Shopping Cart:**
   - The shopping cart should display a list of products that have been added to it, with the quantity of each product and the total price of all products in the cart.
   - Users should be able to remove items from the cart.
   - The shopping cart's state should persist even if the page is refreshed.

3. **Routing:**
   - Implement routing in your application to have separate pages for the Product List and Shopping Cart.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your components using a testing library of your choice.

**Bonus Points:**

- Use a state management library (e.g., Redux or Context API) to manage the shopping cart's state.
- Make the UI visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Implement error handling for the API requests.
- Make your application responsive.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Your ability to set up a React application from scratch.
- Understanding of React concepts such as state, props, lifecycle methods, and hooks.
- Familiarity with routing in React.
- Testing your components.
- Code organization and cleanliness.
- Error handling and UI/UX considerations.
