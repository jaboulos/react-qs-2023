Certainly! Here's a common React interview question that assesses your understanding of component lifecycle, state and props, as well as your problem-solving skills:

**Problem Statement**:
Create a simple React application that fetches data from an API, displays the data in a list, and allows the user to filter the list by a text input. You may use the following API endpoint that provides a list of users: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

**Requirements**:
1. Fetch data from the API on component mount and store it in the state.
2. Display the list of user names on the page.
3. Above the list, provide a text input field that allows the user to filter the list by the user's name.
4. Ensure that the filtering is case-insensitive.
5. Provide a clear and concise code, and manage the state of the component appropriately.

Here's a template to get you started:

<!--
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const UserList = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');
  const [filteredUsers, setFilteredUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data from API
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Implement filtering logic
  }, [filterText, users]);

  const handleFilterChange = (e) => {
    // Update filter text
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={filterText}
        onChange={handleFilterChange}
        placeholder="Filter by user name"
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredUsers.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserList;
```

In this template, `UserList` is the main component that you will be working within. You'll need to complete the `useEffect` and `handleFilterChange` functions to meet the requirements of the problem statement. -->
