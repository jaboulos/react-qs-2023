export const prompt1text = `Below is a sample React interview question along with a brief problem statement. The question is designed to test your understanding of React components, state, and props:

### Problem Statement:

You are required to create a simple React application to manage a list of tasks. Each task has a title and a status (either 'Complete' or 'Incomplete').

Your application should meet the following requirements:

1. Display a list of tasks.
2. Allow the user to add new tasks.
3. Allow the user to mark tasks as 'Complete' or 'Incomplete'.
4. Provide a button to clear all completed tasks.

#### Bonus:
- Implement functionality to edit a task.
- Persist the tasks in local storage so that they are not lost when the page is refreshed.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Proper use of React components, state, and props.
- Handling user events (e.g., button clicks).
- Implementing conditional rendering.
- (Bonus) Local storage manipulation for data persistence.
- (Bonus) Demonstrating an understanding of React's lifecycle methods or hooks (e.g., 'useEffect') to manage side effects like local storage updates.

### Deliverables:
- A working React application meeting the described requirements.
- Clear, well-organized code following React best practices.
- (Optional) A live demo of the application hosted on a platform like CodeSandbox or GitHub Pages.
- (Optional) A brief explanation of your design decisions and any challenges you encountered.

Feel free to ask if you would like clarification on any part of this problem or if you'd like additional information!`;
